This is a game that I developed while I was in second semester of my B.Sc. course. I programmed this game using iGraphics header file of C++. I used Visual Studio 2013 for programming and used Photoshop CS6 for graphical works.

This is a multiplayer game. Two players can play at a time. For second player, just press enter during gameplay. Player 1 can play using keyboard and player 2 can play using mouse.
